# Kotlin Multiplatform POC - Plate Calc

### Overview
------------

This project is a small exploration of the capabilities of using Kotlin Multiplatform to have shared logic between Android and iOS.  The apps are calculators which display a visual representation of what one end of a barbell should look like based on the total weight of the bar the user inputs.  This is powered by MVP logic contained in the common code, settings managed by russhwolf's library (linked below), and Firebase for analytics and crash reporting.

### Latest updates

------------

Added unit tests and a special plate randomization mode.

Next up:
- iOS UI
- Firebase analytics and crash reporting
- Logging (probably via Timber)
